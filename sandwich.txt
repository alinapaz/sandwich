Farmer's Lunch

My favorite sandwich is the Farmer's Lunch at City Feed and Supply in Jamaica Plain, MA. 
It consists of granny smith apple, french-style mustard, mayo, cabot cheddar on a baguette.
It is the best sandwich in the world.

You can't get it in San Francisco.
It really is the best sandwich in the world.
